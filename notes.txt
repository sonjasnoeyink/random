- Git - Not a programming language, rather a control system. Version/Source control.
        - Why do we use git? Why is it important?
            - Collaboration with developers across the world.
            - A default location for all developers to access pertinent source code.
            - Saves $$ and time for developers and companies.
               - For example, if I worked at a tech company and for whatever reason we didn't use source control,
               all the source code was on my machine. If my machine crashed one day, everyone is screwed.
            - We as a tech team releases a 2.0 version of software and later found it had a severe bug,
            I could revert to a previous version that I know is stable and tested.



- Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket - The hub for all this source code for developers.



- Terminal  - This is where we execute the git commands
        - git add
        - git commit
        - git reset
        - git status
        - git pull/push
